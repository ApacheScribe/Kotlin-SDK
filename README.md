# Kotlin-SDK
Kotlin-SDK for thenewboston.

## Introduction
This is the Kotlin SDK with primary focus for Android and Desktop. This repository contains a dummy android project which will demonstrate how to use 
the SDK. <br/><br/>
The library itself will solely contain the domain and data layers of thenewboston. The presentation layer will be the responsibility of <br/>
the host application (see our demo application). We'll be using Clean Architecture to structure the layers, dependencies and communication flow. <br/>
To not be coupled to the android platform we'll use following libraries:
1. Coroutines for Asynchronous / Parallel Processing
2. Ktor for Http Calls
